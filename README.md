# Backtesting the Value at Risk using a GARCH Model

This project centers on the backtesting of Value at Risk (VaR) measures for the S&P 500 and FTSE 100 financial indices using the GARCH(1,1)-Normal model. The approach entails computing log returns for these indices, estimating VaR using a static approach, then conducting a rolling window backtest.
